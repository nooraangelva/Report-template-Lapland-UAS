The English Aalto SST logos were created by Kimmo JÃ¤rvinen as follows:

1) From https://inside.aalto.fi/display/INSIDE/en

Tools -> Logo Generator
or Tools -> Visual Identity Materials

obtain three PDF CMYK Uncoated logos (for printing rather than screen),
each with a different delimiter: ? ! "

2) Open each of the three logos in the Inkscape program. First, remove
the extra white area around the logo (File->Document Properties 
and click "Fit page to selection").

3) The correct Aalto RGB colours should then be set by hand, 
accoording to their specific values:

red:    237,41,57 (ED2939)
blue:   00,101,189 (0065BD)
yellow: 254,203,00 (FECB00)
